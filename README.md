Hello there! I assume youre here to see my project! Well, I would tell you a bit about it. I've created it long ago, when I just started diving into Python.
Here I used everything I know! Starting from HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Python(and its libraries, of course). I created something like Instagram, Facebook, but a lot simpler, of course...
It has all teh functionalities. You can sign up, sign in, log out, create post, write a comment. I really would like to publish it one day. But it needs a lot of work, indeed. 
Hope you enjoy looking at the code I wrote:) Have a great day.
